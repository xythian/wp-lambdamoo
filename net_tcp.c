/* So, historically, only 'name_lookup_timeout' existed and applied to
 * both inbound and outbound connections.  But these are really
 * different situations and need to have separate settings.  Which
 * means one of them has to be a new option, but defaulting to the old
 * one for backwards compatibility.
 *
 * We *could* have made the new one be the one governing outbound
 * connections, but since the setting for inbound connections is the
 * one people are way more likely to want to change (i.e., to set to 0
 * because, now that the year is 2024 and reverse-DNS is almost
 * completely useless), having the default for outbound be the inbound
 * setting would force everyone wanting to turn off inbound lookups to
 * make a *second* setting to restore the outbound default, which
 * would be a huge pain.  So that is why it's the other way around
 * (inbound defaults to outbound).
 *
 * And, yes, the naming is confusing:  "name lookup" can EITHER mean
 * you *have* a name that you are looking up to get information about
 * it, or you have the other information and want to look up the
 * corresponding name.  English is stupid; film at 11.
 *
 * Here we are going with the former interpretation, which also
 * happens to put the new name with the new option, hence,
 * the option is named after the thing you provide:
 *
 *   "name_lookup" is for when you have a name and need an address
 *      (i.e., "ordinary" DNS A query for outbound connections)
 *   "address_lookup" is for when you have an address and want a name
 *      (i.e., "reverse" DNS PTR query for inbound connections)
 *
 * Sorry if this seems backwards to you, but we're in a no-win
 * situation here.                  --wrog (8/27/2024)
