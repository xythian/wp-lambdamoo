 *       ./configure --enable-sz=bq32 (... whatever model you want)
 *       rm -f byte_quota_test
 *       make byte_quota_test && ./byte_quota_test
 *
 * (2) If you are adding a new type, it perhaps does not truly matter
 *     how big you declare it to be, since, presumably, none of the
 *     legacy dbs will have instances of it, but best practice would
 *     be to guess how big it *would* have been on typical early-2000s
 *     32- and 64- bit hardware, respectively.
 *
 * extensions that mess with structure sizes should
 * create a boolean option in options.ac and options.h.in
 *   BQM_<ext>
 *     (where <ext> is the #define name for when the the extension is
 *     active), which indicates whether the extension is active for
 *     the purposes of the byte quota model (regardless of whether the
 *     extension itself is indeed active),
 *
 * then make it default to the setting of <ext> (in options_epilog.h)

 *
 * ------------------------------------
 * Re: wtf is going on with BQM_SIZEOF?
 * ------------------------------------
 * In case you were wondering, the problem here is that the C
 * preprocessor goes out of its way to disable recursion.
 * What we **want** is
 *
 *    #define BQM_SIZEOF(type)     \
 *       BQM_DESCRIBE_##type(BQM_SIZEOF, BQM_FOUR_,BQM_VAR_,BQM_EXT_)
 *
 * which does not work because, in any expansion of BQM_SIZEOF,
 * 'BQM_SIZEOF' will be on the list of identifiers not to be further
 * expanded, so that symbol comes out as itself, unexpanded, and
 * simply left there for the compiler to trip over.
 *
 * To make this work we need to give BQM_SIZEOF a different name
 * ('BQM_BASE_') in the expansion and then give that identifier the
 * *same* definition with yet another name in *its* expansion
 * ('BQM_BASE_##type'), and so on... As it happens, using
 * BQM_BASE_##type for the 2nd..nth time around gives us a wide
 * variety of names, and, furthermore, C forbids cycles of structs
 * including each other (you can have cycles of *pointers* but that's
 * different), so once we have definitions of BQM_BASE_<type> for all
 * types that this encounters, we're done.  But we don't even have to
 * do that since most types don't use B().  The only cases we have to
 * worry about are the length>=2 chains, the following being the only
 * one we have at the moment:
 *
 *     forked_task  uses B(activation)
 *     activation   uses B(Var)         (if #defined(WAIF_CORE))
 *     Var          does not use B()
 *
 * so this ends.  So, since activation is both referred to and
 * uses B() itself, we need a definition for BQM_BASE_activation()
 *
 * You can see this in action by commenting out the
 * BQM_BASE_activation #define and attempting a compile.
 * The error will be something like
 *
 *    "expected ‘)’ before ‘BQM_BASE_activation’",
 *
 * which tells you what needs to be #defined.  So if you should manage
 * to create more of these situations, now you know what to do.
