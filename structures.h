 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.4.2.1  2002/08/29 05:44:24  bjj
 * Add WAIF type as distributed in version 0.95 (one small merge).
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1998/12/14 13:19:04  nop
 * Merge UNSAFE_OPTS (ref fixups); fix Log tag placement to fit CVS whims
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1997/07/07 03:24:55  nop

 *
 * Revision 1.2.2.1  1997/03/20 18:07:52  bjj
 * Add a flag to the in-memory type identifier so that inlines can cheaply
 * identify Vars that need actual work done to ref/free/dup them.  Add the
 * appropriate inlines to utils.h and replace old functions in utils.c with
 * complex_* functions which only handle the types with external storage.

 * Moved db_modification code to db modules.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  1992/09/04  01:17:29  pavel

 *
 * Revision 1.8  1992/09/03  16:25:12  pjames
 * Added TYPE_CLEAR for Var.
 * Changed Property definition lists to be arrays instead of linked lists.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  1992/08/31  22:25:04  pjames
